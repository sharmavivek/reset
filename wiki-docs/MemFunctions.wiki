==== Details ====
 # *bcopy* 
	#include <string.h>
	void bcopy(const void *src, void *dst, int n); 

	The bcopy() function performs byte string copy. bcopy() copies n bytes from string src to string dst. The result is correct, even when both areas overlap. use  memcpy(3)  or  memmove(3) in new programs.
